                <h4 class="home-msg">I'm an award winning photographer (first and second prize at the Arizona State Fair). I've built this website to display my best work as an automotive photographer. 
                    This portfolio is reserved for the photos that I'm most proud of, but I've taken many more photos in my career, and plan on doing more work. You can even contact me using the tab at the top of this page 
                    if you're interested in receiving pictures of your own car. I hope to attract car enthusiasts and photography buffs alike, even if you're somewhere in between. 
                    No matter where you stand on the spectrum, I invite you to stick around here for a while and check out the cool images.</h4>
