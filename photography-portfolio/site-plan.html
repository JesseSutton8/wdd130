        About<br><br>
        I'm an award winning photographer (first and second prize at the Arizona State Fair). I've built this website to display my best work 
        as an automotive photographer. This portfolio is reserved for the photos that I'm most proud of, but I've taken many more photos 
        in my career, and plan on doing more work. You can even contact me using the tab at the top of this page if you're interested in 
        receiving pictures of your own car. I hope to attract car enthusiasts and photography buffs alike, even if you're somewhere in between.
        No matter where you stand on the spectrum, I invite you to stick around here for a while and check out the cool images. <br><br>

      <h3>Locations and descriptions of the photos</h3>
      <p>
        Virtually every single photo on this website was taken in the western part of the United States - Arizona, California, and Utah. I'd
        like to walk you through the specific places where most of them were shot, and my favorite ones. <br><br><br>

        Being from Arizona, the majority of my content will be from the Scottsdale/Paradise Valley area because that's where most of the local
        car scene is. Here's an outline:<br><br>

        Cars and Coffee <br>
        On the first Saturday of every month, people from all over the state gather together in Phoenix to show off their cars. This 
        event is hosted by a group called Highline Autos. <br><br>

        Concourse in the Hills <br>
        Located at Fountain Park in Paradise Valley, this is a massive car show which happens once a year on February. This was personally 
        the first big show I ever attended. There were cars of every caliber you could imagine, from JDM, to American Muscle, to European Hypercars. <br><br>
        
        Barrett-Jackson <br>
        The Barrett-Jackson is another big show in Scottsdale area that happens once per year, but this one takes place in January. This is mainly an auto auction,
        but anyone can purchase tickets and look around in their showroom which is filled with crazy cars that companies put on display. <br><br>

        Lamborghini Scottsdale/McLaren Scottsdale <br>
        Often overlooked, the respective Scottsdale showrooms of Lamborghini and McLaren are both great places for car spotting. I've been lucky
        enough to see some pretty rare cars that were only around for a limited time. For example, I was able to see a Lamborghini Centenario.
        Unfortunately I was only able to get pictures with my iPhone so I won't be putting them on this site. <br><br>

      <h3>Contact information and prices for a photoshoot</h3>
      <p>
        If you've enjoyed your stay on my website and admire my original content, you may consider signing up for a photoshoot of your own vehicle.
        I would be happy to provide you with some personalized and unique art of your own for a reasonable fee. It would be preferable
        that you live in Arizona; photography is not my full time job and I can't make the commitment to travel for it just yet. I have locations
        of my own that we can shoot, but I would be more than willing to take requests if you know somewhere cool. I look forward to hearing
        from you! <br><br>

        You can reach me here <br>
        Email: [fakeemail@gmail.com] <br>
        Phone: [fake phone number] <br><br>

        Here are my rates <br>
        30 minute shoot: $25 <br>
        1 hour shoot: $50 <br>
        2 hour shoot: $85
