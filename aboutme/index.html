    <h2>Jesse Sutton</h2>
    <p>My name is Jesse Sutton. I live in AZ and I'm majoring in computer science. I'm currently recovering from hip surgery which is why I'm taking my classes online from home right now, after which I will be serving a mission in Jacksonville FL where I was called a couple months ago. Typically my hobbies include playing pickle ball and working out at the gym; however with my limited mobility I've resorted to thrifting, discovering and listening to a ton of music, and playing Fortnite while holed up in my house. On top of that I've been cracking down on my daily scripture study as I prepare for my mission.</p>
    <p>I took CSE 110 and 111 before this class and I absolutely loved them. I'm excited to learn more programming languages in addition to python, and I look forward to learning the skills to make web pages in this class. Honestly I'm uncertain which career I'd like to pursue with the things I've learned from my CS major; everything I've learned interests me so far and I'm interested to see what else this class brings.</p>
    <p>I had the good fortune of being born into the church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. This might sound cliche but my favorite quote from a church leader is one that I heard from a recent conference talk by President Nelson: "Think Celestial". My favorite scripture comes from Ether 12, and it is "If men come unto me I will show unto them their weakness. I give unto men weakness that they may be humble; and my grace is sufficient for all men that humble themselves before me;for if they humble themselves before me, and have faith in me, then I will make weak things become strong unto them."</p>
